The attempted finished product of my programming for cultural heritage project will be a web-hosted interactive map of lead and copper contamination in public drinking water supplies on a national scale. This map will pinpoint results that are above the safety threshold, color-code for occurrence of unsafe levels in a given water utility and link users to part-per-billion measurements when they click on a pin. The target data will be that produced by public water supply monitoring initiatives reported to state-level environmental protection agencies in compliance with the updated 2007 Lead and Copper Rule. This federal regulation mandates that water utilities collect samples at residential taps and service lines and report their results to the state-level EPA if more than ten percent of taps test above the allowable limit (i.e. the 90 percentile rule). 

One of the major hurdles to completion of this project is to engineer an efficient way to aggregate data from all fifty state agencies. While federal-level water quality data portals and data warehouses [e.g. [STORET](https://ofmpub.epa.gov/storpubl/dw_pages.querycriteria), [National Water Quality Monitoring Council data portal](https://www.waterqualitydata.us/portal/), [NWIS](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis) are available to provide access across all state-level agencies, there does not appear to be a way to specify the exact sample collection method or facilities (public water services) that I am interested in.
